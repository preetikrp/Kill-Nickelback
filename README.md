# Kill-Nickelback
Exercise using HashSets, Tuples, and Lists.

## Instructions

1. Define a List, named `goodSongs`, that will hold tuples consisting of two strings.
1. Define a HashSet, named `allSongs`, that contains 7 tuples. Each tuple should contain two string values:
    1. The name of an artist
    1. A song by that artist

    ```cs
    // Example
    HashSet<(string, string)> songs = new HashSet<(string, string)>();
    ```

    Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Nickelback. You can see a [list of their greatest hits](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Nickelback-1/dp/B00FFERTUK/) on Amazon.
1. Once the set is populated with 7 tuples, iterate over the set of songs, and check if the band name is "Nickelback".
1. If the band is **not** Nickelback, then add it to the `goodSongs` list.
1. USe another `foreach` loop to print out all the good songs.
